## I. Definitions

### Relational Magnitudes

The **relational position** ($\mathbf{r}\_i$), **relational velocity** ($\mathbf{v}\_i$), and **relational acceleration** ($\mathbf{a}\_i$) of a particle "i", relative to the **Auxiliary Reference System**, are given by:

$\mathbf{r}\_i = \vec{r}\_i$

$\mathbf{v}\_i = \dfrac{d(\vec{r}\_i)}{dt} = \vec{v}\_i$

$\mathbf{a}\_i = \dfrac{d^2(\vec{r}\_i)}{dt^2} = \vec{a}\_i$

Where $\vec{r}\_i$, $\vec{v}\_i$ and $\vec{a}\_i$ are the ordinary vectorial position, ordinary vectorial velocity, and ordinary vectorial acceleration of the particle "i" with respect to the **Arbitrary Reference System**.

**Note**

The Relational (Vectorial) Magnitudes are always the same as the Ordinary (Vectorial) Magnitudes in the Auxiliary Reference System.
